Pixcope - Quick Help

What is the dev server?
- The dev server is only for development/testing. It serves the web app and API while you are iterating.
- You do NOT need it when using the packaged desktop app (Pixcope.exe).

Normal workflow (recommended)
1) Launch the desktop app:
   - Open release/Pixcope-win32-x64/Pixcope.exe
   - The API starts automatically inside the app.
2) Edit services in the Excel file as needed.
3) Click Refresh Workbook in the app (or wait for auto-sync).
4) Create or open a project estimate.
5) Click Save to keep the estimate for later.

Dev/testing workflow
- Run: npm run dev (web) or npm run dev:desktop (desktop dev)
- Keep the terminal open while testing.

Saving projects
- Click Save in the right-side panel to store the estimate.
- Saved projects are kept locally in projects.json in the Pixcope data folder.

If you close without saving
- Unsaved changes are lost. The last saved version is what you will see next time.

Closing the app
- Using the window X is enough to close the app.
- No extra close button is needed.

Excel sync timing
- Auto-sync happens about every 8 seconds.
- You can force a refresh with the Refresh Workbook button.

Notes
- Desktop app data (workbook + saved projects) lives in your user data folder.
- If you want to update these instructions, edit help.txt.
