Embers - Quick Help

Daily workflow
1) Log today.
2) Complete the day to lock it.
3) Only one day can stay open at a time.

Focus mode
- Use the target icon to enter focus mode (hides navigation and keeps only today visible).
- Toggle it off anytime.

Open day rule
- If you leave a previous day open, Embers will prompt you to continue or finalize it first.

Workbook sync
- The workbook syncs on app launch and when you click Refresh Workbook.
- Edit habits in data/embers-habits.xlsx, then press Refresh.

Saving
- Save Day writes your progress without locking the day.
- Complete Day locks the day and shows a snapshot of done vs not done.

Closing the app
- If you have unsaved changes, Embers prompts you to save or close without saving.

Dev/testing
- Run: npm run dev (web) or npm run dev:desktop (desktop dev)
- Keep the terminal open while testing.

Notes
- All data is local-first.
- If you want to update these instructions, edit help.txt.
